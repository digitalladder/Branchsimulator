Compile the codes using command:Make.
The code has already compiled, so using the command:
"./branchsimulator.out config.txt trace.txt"
will execute the simulator.
You can see prediction result in file 'trace.txt.out'.
In the file "branchsimulator.cpp" is the main code.
The config file 'config.txt' contains two lines, the first with the value of m and the second with the value of k.
The trace file, trace.txt, contains one branch per line.
